You are given a list of N phone numbers
You must make sure that the phonebook is consistent.
The phonebook is said to be consistent when no number in the phonebook is a prefix of any other number
This is necessary since if any number is a prefix of any other number it will be redirected to that 
number while dialing
For example:
A: 1234
B: 12
Suppose we want to dial A we start dialing 1->2 and at this point we will be directed to be since the number 12 corresponds to B.
In this case the phonebook is said to be inconsistent
 

Input Description:
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of phone numbers in the phonebook The next N line contains a single phone number per line . Each phone number contains 20 digits at most

Output Description:
The output must consist of a single line containing “Consistent” (without quotes) if the phonebook was consistent or “Inconsistent” (without quotes) if the phonebook was inconsistent

Sample Input :
2
1234
12
Sample Output :
Inconsistent


Solution:::
n = int(input())
l = []
for i in range(n):
    l.append(int(input()))
l.sort()
l = [str(i) for i in l]
flag = True
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if len(l[i]) <= len(l[j]):
            if l[i] == l[j][0:len(l[i])]:
                flag = False
                break
        if len(l[i]) > len(l[j]):
            if l[j] == l[i][0:len(l[j])]:
                flag = False
                break
if flag:print("Consistent")
else:print("Inconsistent")
